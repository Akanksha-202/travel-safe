## What Does It Do? 
Travel Safe is dedicated to empowering women's safety during their travels. By incorporating the virtual connection feature, the app strives to provide a heightened sense of security and peace of mind, allowing women to navigate their journeys with increased confidence and assurance. We understand the importance of maintaining security, particularly when utilizing transportation services in unfamiliar locations. Our new faking video call feature is designed to help you establish a perceived connection with your family or friends, creating an added deterrent for any potential risks.

## Backstory: Why We Built This Project
The idea for TravelSafe was born from a personal experience I had one night when I was traveling from the airport at 1:00 am. Everyone in my family was asleep, and I couldn't reach my best friend. The thought of being alone with the cab driver made me feel scared and uncomfortable. I desperately wished I could just video call someone at that moment for reassurance. This experience led me to realize that many women face similar situations while traveling late at night in public transport. I began to envision a solution that would not only allow women to make fake video calls, simulating real conversations to deter potential threats, but also share their location and the car's license plate with their loved ones for an added layer of safety. Thus, the idea of TravelSafe was born, aiming to provide women with the means to protect themselves and feel safer during their journeys.
